# Sorts

## Analysis Includes

### 1. Time Complexity

### 2. Space Complexity

### 3. Adaptability
- True, if the algorithm changes it's Time Complexity based on the changes made in the Input List
- Analysis based on Sorted Input VS Unsorted Input

### 4. Stability
- True, if the order of elements is preserved
- Useful when 2 or more elements of same value is present

### 5. K-Passes
- True, if first K-Passes of the algorithm produces useful results
- Useful when we need only the first k smallest/largest elements from the list
