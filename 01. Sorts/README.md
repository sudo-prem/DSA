# Sorts

## Analysis Includes

<br>

1. Time Complexity

<br>

2. Space Complexity

<br>

3. Adaptability

- True, if the algorithm changes it's Time Complexity based on the changes made in the Input List
- Analysis based on Sorted Input VS Unsorted Input

<br>

4. Stability

- True, if the order of elements is preserved
- Useful when 2 or more elements of same value is present

<br>

5. K-Passes

- True, if first K-Passes of the algorithm produces useful results
- Useful when we need only the first k smallest/largest elements from the list
